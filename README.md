This is a source code for icra 2020 contributed paper: 
"**Real-time Continuous Hand Motion  Myoelectric Decoding by  Automated Data Labelling**"
 This code will be able to predict the hand motion of three degrees of freedom , 
 hand open/close, wrist flex/extension, wrist deviation, wrist rotation has been tested, feel free to train your model from scratch!

The annotation is being translated from Chinese to English, thank you for your patience

### System framework
Since all the work is done with python, I perfer to find a SDK of MYO running with the same language.
However,the compatibility I found in Windows seems not as good as in Linux. Therefore, considering a wearable application, 
I choose my Windows desktop to train the model, and use a raspberry pi as sub-proccessor to interface with MYO,
and to run the prediction model offline and real-time. 

Data training on a non-embedded device is time consuming,even the signal preprocessing.
If your computer is running with linux, you can run all the code in your computer as a indoor usage.


### Scripts Execution Pipeline
1. run **Collect_and_preprocess.py** first on your raspberry pi(tested on Zero and 3B+)
2. transfer the data to your Windows PC
3. run **HG_AEN.py** on your PC to train the data (much time efficiency)
4. transfer your trained matrices to your raspberry pi
5. run **unity_hand.py** on your raspberry pi
